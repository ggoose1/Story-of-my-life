<h1><center><b>The Life of Geoffrey Goose</b></center></h1>

<h2> <center>From where it all started <center> </h2>

<p>I was born in Boston, Massachusetts not but 20 brief years ago.</p>

<p> It was there I discovered my love for my beloved city: <u> Boston </u>

<p> Here, is where I learned to ride a bike, shoot a basket, and drive a car. Despite being perfect in every way, Boston does have <i> some </i> <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/cities/articles/10-cities-with-the-worst-traffic-in-the-us">problems </a> when it comes to driving especially. At least now, everywhere I go has no traffic compared to Boston... woooo number one baby go sox! </p>

<p> Something not in Boston is ski instructing. From about the time I could walk, I've been in skis. Then literally the day I turned 14, I started working as a ski instructor. I learned many applicable life skills on the job:</p>

<ul>
<li> Work ethic </li>
<li> The true meaning of a shitty job after bathroom breaks </li>
<li> How beutiful teaching can be </li> </ul>

<p> I've had a lot of great experiences in my life and I'm excited for it only to continue </p>
